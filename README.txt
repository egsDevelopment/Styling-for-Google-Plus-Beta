Change Google+ to look how you want it to look. Remove usless items, Change colors, Customize the navigation bar, and more

This is the beta version of the Styling for Google Plus extension found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cliffclebhbijaimimdcllfhgfckbfbf . The entire extension is being redone including the user interface. To give the users of the stable version a preview of the added functionality and new interface I'm releasing this extension. 

NOTE: This is in beta and as such  you may experience some errors or bugs. Please report them in the comments or by emailing eshaw@egs-development.com.

Updated: Fixed a few of the features that wasn't working and initialized all the variables for a first time around. This may reset your settings if you update (sorry). I still have a bit of work to do on the right column because Google+ randomly had Games and Mobile so I'm thinking of one button to hide Invites, Pages, Games, and Mobile (to be implemented). I also added a Remove Scroll check box and set the default scroll bar to a thin grey bar. (if you don't notice try doing ctrl+shift+r on the Google+ page a few times it should show up then) 

Features:

     * Add Google Reader, Calendar, Gmail Counters with hover box giving you a preview. 
     * Hide different elements of the Google+ page
     * Change (some) font colors 
     * Scrollable comments
     * Remove Scroll Bars
     * More to come soon including: background colors, themes, and functionality for 
       other Google+ pages
